# Bitcoin-Delphi-Library
A Bitcoin library for Delphi

This library tries to use Bitcoin RPC communication for BlockChain analysis so you need to have bitcoind.exe client running and the blockchain available.

The first purpose is first just to make it up and running with Delphi 10.3 Community Edition.
Then as next step, we want to use that as an example to use with Marmara Chain for a simple GUI for creating and circulating Marmara Credit Loops (MCL). We need to modify the program to used with komodod.exe and komodo-cli.exe
